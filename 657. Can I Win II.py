# Medium
# There is an array of positive integers, 
# in which each integer represents a piece of Pizzaâ€™s size, 
# you and your friend take turns to pick pizza from either end of the array.  
# Your friend follows a simple strategy: 
# He will always pick the larger one he could get during his turn. 
# The winner is the one who gets the larger total sum of all pizza. 
# Return the max amount of pizza you can get.

# Assumption: 
# If during your friend's turn, 
# the leftmost pizza has the same size as the rightmost pizza, 
# he will pick the rightmost one.

# Example:
# Input: [2,1,100,3]
# Output: 102

# Explanation: 
# To win the game, 
# you pick 2 first, 
# then your friend will pick either 3, 
# after that you could pick 100. 
# In the end you could get 2 + 100 = 102, 
# while your friend could only get 1 + 3 = 4.
