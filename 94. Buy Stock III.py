# Medium
# Given an array of positive integers representing a stockâ€™s price on each day. 
# On each day you can only make one operation: 
# either buy or sell one unit of stock, 
# at any time you can only hold at most one unit of stock, 
# and you can make at most 2 transactions in total. 
# Determine the maximum profit you can make.

# Assumptions
# The give array is not null and is length of at least 2

# Examples
# {2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 2, 11}, the maximum profit you can make is (5 - 1) + (11 - 2) = 13
